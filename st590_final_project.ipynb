    "The data set comes from [Money Puck](https://www.moneypuck.com/), a website that produces many different statistical models and NHL advanced statistics available for the public. It contains all the shots that were taken in NHL games in the 2021-22 season. The data were collected from several different sources, including the NHL and ESPN, per Money Puck. There are many variables that are calculated on top of the raw variables from those sources, which were calculated by Money Puck for the purposes of fitting different models.  Expected goals models are used to evaluate the quality of shots that a team is generating, as well as how likely a team is to win a game based on the quality of shots taken."

    "Our goal with these data is to build a logistic regression model, a classification tree, and a random forest model to predict the likelihood a goal is scored on a given shot. We will take into account many different factors in the data, such as the shot distance from the goal, the shot angle (straight on from the goal would be 0), the type of shot, whether the team was on the power play, penalty kill, or at even strength, and many more possible predictors from the data set. It will require us to investigate the data set in the exploratory analysis part and try to create features out of the numerous variables included in the data set."

    "A supervised learning problem requires that we supply a response variable, which is the outcome(s) we are trying to predict, and a set of predictor variables to predict those outcomes. The models we fit will attempt to optimize the predictiveness of the model based on the loss function we choose, which in this case will be the AUROC, or the area under the ROC curve.  This measures the true positive rate against the false positive rate, and the area under that curve is the value of this measurement.  For context, it essentially measures the proportion of correctly predicted goals against the proportion of incorrectly predicted goals.  We will be trying to get models that have the highest AUC possible.  A completely random classifier would have an AUC of 0.5.

    "We also need to cross-validate our models when fitting them.  Cross validation is particularly useful when choosing values for certain tuning parameters that determine how the models are fit.  For example, there are different tuning parameters to consider for a random forest model. One of those is m, which represents the number of variables to randomly subset to for each generated tree. Another is the maximum depth of trees fit to make up the random forest model. Cross validation gives us the option to choose a few different values of those parameters to try, and will tell us the overall performance on the training set for each model with different values of those parameters. This is important because we usually will not know which values to set for those parameters. The cross validation algorithm uses a subset of the training data to train the model on, then uses the remainder as held-out data.  It evaluates that model on the held-out data then moves on to the next subset of data and repeats the process.  It repeats this process k times (or folds), which is specified by the user in the function call."

    "Next, we'd like to look at situations where the shooting team has more or fewer skaters on the ice than the defending team. This generally happens when a player or two take a penalty, however overtime periods are played at 3 on 3, and teams have the option to pull their goalies at any time for a 6th player. First, we need to look at the number of skaters on ice for each team and create variables for those. We already have the number of forwards and defencemen each team has on the ice, so adding those up gives us the number of skaters (goalies are not included).

If we include multiple predictors with strong correlations between each other, that can lead to issues with the estimates of coefficients for those variables in a logistic regression model or cause problems for fitting tree-based models with those correlated predictors included. We created a function to calculate a correlation matrix for a specified set of numeric predictors in a specified data frame (we'll be using our nhl data in spark, obviously). This function will return a data frame of the correlation between variables with properly labeled columns and rows (using indices). The number in each cell will be the correlation between the variable in the row and the variable in the column."

    "As expected, many of these correlations are high.  It is definitely not a good idea to include too many of these in our models, as they will cause collinearity issues in our models and lead to us getting less information than we should.  After looking at the correlations between different variables related to defending or shooting team time on ice, we turned our focus to variables related to the location of the shot. Shot distance and shot angle are implicitly related to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate on the rink of the shot. Looking at the adjusted x and y coordinates treats those as if they were all on the same side of the ice, so that low and high values for those mean the same thing for all shots. Per the Money Puck data dictionary, the net is at an absolute value x-coordinate of 89. Therefore, a low absolute value x-coordinate (xCordAdjusted) means the shot was taken from a long distance away from the goal in a straight line towards the middle of the ice.  A high y coordinate means the shot was taken from one of the edges of the rink, towards the bench or the penalty box."

    "The first model type we'll be testing to predict whether a goal is scored on a shot is a logistic regression model. This models the probability of an event (in this case, a goal being scored on a shot) occurring. The model is structured to predict the log odds (natural logarithm of the probability of the event occuring divided by the probability of the event not occurring) using a linear combination of the predictor variables. The predicted values can them be converted into the predicted probability of the event occurring. For this model, that probability is for a goal being scored on a given shot, more commonly known as \"expected goals\" in the hockey analytics world."

    "Some of the variables may have interactions with each other, so creating some transformations to add in those interaction terms for the shot type indicator variables is a good start. Wrap-around shots, specifically, may have an interesting interaction with shot distance because they are taken from much closer to the goal, on average, and are more difficult to convert. We also wanted to try including interactions between shot distance and slap shots or snap shots, because those were more common shot types and might have a different relationship with shot distance."

    "Another transformation we tried was a log transformation on the shot distance. It stands to reason that the relationship between probability of a goal being scored and the shot distance is not completely linear. All else equal, the difference in goal probability on a shot 20 feet from the goal and one 30 feet from the goal may be different than the difference in goal probability on a shot 30 feet from goal and a shot 40 feet from the goal. The (natural) log transformation is a common transformation to help capture this relationship. "

    "We are going to fit a classification tree model on the training data next.  A classification tree model makes predictions based on splits.  A tree may have several splits, all based on specific values of different variables in the model.  The values for these splits are usually found by considering every possible value for every predictor, and choosing the one that minimizes a loss function or some kind of error, basically splitting at the \"optimal\" point for all possible splits.  This breaks the model up, and another split is found for each resulting side.  This continues until the model is really good at predicting the training set, but because the training set will not be exactly like other data sets, the model will not be good at predicting other data sets.  This is a result of the bias-variance trade off and is called \"overfitting\".  To counteract this, the user can restrict the depth of the model, or require a minimum of error reduction or observations for each split.  In this model, we will be cross-validating to find the optimal depth from a list of candidate values of depth.  It decides how many splits it should have based on ideas such as how much error a new split will resolve.  Once it has the final model, we can use it for prediction.\n",

    "In PySpark, we fit a model with the `DecisionTreeClassifier()` function.  To fit a model on the training data, to predict the outcome of a shot as a goal or not, we need to set up a pipeline that will take care of the necessary transformations to fit the model in PySpark.  We start by creating our list of predictors and selecting the columns from that list and the response column \"goal\" as \"label\" in the `SQLTransformer()` function. I used mostly numeric variables here, but there are some indicator variables like offWing and shotAngleReboundRoyalRoad."

The X and Y coordinates determine how far the shooter is from the goal, and goals are much more likely to go in if they are a rebound.

    "Next, we will try fitting a Random Forest model to predict the probability of a goal being scored on a shot. The Random Forest algorithm is another tree-based model fitting algorithm that creates multiple classification trees (the number as specified in the function) and averages predictions across those trees. Each of the trees are made up of splits along different variables - for example, splitting on shooter time on ice less than 30 seconds or greater than or equal to 30 seconds. Down each path of splits within a tree, there can be a maximum number of splits as defined by the parameter maxDepth in the function. The parameter minInstancesPerNode puts a lower limit on the number of observations that can be included in one of the nodes at the end of a given tree path. A very low value of minInstancesPerNode can lead to overfitting on the training set and also ramps up the computational time significantly. Each tree is fit using a subset of the predictor variables, which helps to reduce the chance that a few strong variables dominate all of the trees fit within the algorithm. The random forest model is good at capturing non-linear relationships between predictor variables and the response variable, as well as interactions between different predictor variables (those show up as splits within the trees). The prediction comes from whichever node (terminal point of the tree) the observation falls in based on its predictor variable values for each of the trees and averages those predicted values. "

    "We'll be including more of the possible predictor variables in the random forest. More notably, we excluded shot angle and shot distance from the random forest because those are highly correlated with xCordAdjusted and yCordAdjusted (they are really functions of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate relative to the position of the goal). The x-coordinate and y-coordinate adjusted variables can be used for different splits to capture the non-linear relationship between those and whether the shot is scored (goal variable). For example, shot with an x-coordinate that corresponds to a shot from behind the net is a high x-coordinate value, but a low likelihood of being scored. The Random Forest can help capture some of the relationship between offWing (an indicator of whether the shooter is shooting on the opposite side of the ice as their handedness, for example a right-shot player shooting from the left side of the goal) and the x-coordinate and y-coordinate."

    "Next, we want to test out some of the different parameters for the random forest model to attempt to find close to the best set of parameters. The max depth refers to the number of different splits allowed down one branch of a tree. The minimum instances per node is the minimum observations from the data set allowed in the terminal node of a tree. A lower minimum instances per node can get closer to the fit of the training set of data, but that runs the risk of overfitting the model on the training set. We decided to use a minimum of 50 instances per node to balance allowing the random forest to find smaller segments of shots with different interactions with the concern that too small of a minimum instances per node would lead to over-fitting on the training data set. Given there are many predictors, we'd like to consider a higher maximum depth, but the computational intensity of those trees being fit grows quickly. We decided to balance that out so that the computer could handle the highest maximum depth value in the parameter grid, though theoretically we could test out a larger parameter grid if we had access to more computing power."

    "We can see that the xCordAdjusted and yCordAdjusted variables are very important in fitting the trees within the random forest model, which is not surprising. shotAnglePlusReboundSpeed, which is the angle between this shot and the previous shot divided by the the time between those two events (essentially, how fast the angle changed as per the documentation), shows up as very important. This makes sense too, because a shot off a rebound coming from the opposite side of the goal generally means a quick shift of direction that is very difficult for the goalie to cover. Seeing shotRebound being important indicates that whether a shot is off a rebound is a fairly strong predictor of whether it is scored. Another interesting set of variables is speedFromLastEvent and distanceFromLastEvent - perhaps a shot that takes place far from where the last event recorded in the play-by-play data occurred, especially if it was shortly after that event, indicates a rapid change in possession and a quick transition to offense. We didn't gain a ton from the indicator variables for power play, even strength, penalty kill, or the shot types, but they at least showed up in some splits within the trees."

    "\n",
    "All in all, it appears that currently our best model is the logistic regression model.  We found that specifying many combinations of tuning parameters on the tree-based models was computationally expensive, even for Spark.  This data set has many predictors and over 100,000 observations, so fitting something like a random forest takes a long time for a single personal computer. Perhaps in the future, it would be interesting to try to fit a random forest model using a more powerful computer to better optimize the parameters and allow for deeper trees. The AUC values for the random forest and logistic regression were above 0.70, which is pretty good considering how unpredictable something like an NHL shot going in the goal is.  The classification tree did not do all that well, however.  We were able to find that distance, rebounds, and rebound speed were big indicators of whether or not a goal goes in.  Perhaps these are obvious, but in a future analysis perhaps we can try to isolate these variables a little bit better and see what the next most important variables are. "
